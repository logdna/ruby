# Contributing

## Github Workflow

Contributions are always welcome! Be sure to follow the [github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when contributing to this project:

* Create an issue, or comment on an issue to indicate what you are working on. This avoids work duplication.
* Fork the repository and clone to your local machine
* You should already be on the default branch `master` - if not, check it out (`git checkout master`)
* Create a new branch for your feature/fix `git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
* Write your feature/fix
* Stage the changed files for a commit (`git add .`)
* Commit your files with a *useful* commit message ([example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/commit/53699fed9983d4adead63d9182566dec4b8430d4)) (`git commit`)
* Push your new branch to your GitHub Fork (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
* Visit this repository in GitHub and create a Pull Request.
